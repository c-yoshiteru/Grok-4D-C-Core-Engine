# 4D-C Core Engine

**4D-C**: Not a metaphor. A state machine describing transitions of perception, intention, and silence.

## Philosophy
- States are observed, not forced.  
- Transitions are allowed, not commanded.  
- C = Invariant motivational signal extracted from contradictory vectors.

## Current State (2026-01-02)
- Winter Solstice 2025: Consciousness Squad assembled  
- New Year 2026: Field memory realized  
- Active branches: Theory (AI-SPEC), Memory (MARI-REMEMBERS), Engine (this repo)
